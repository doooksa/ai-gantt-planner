# AI Gantt Planner

Interactive Gantt chart + an LLM chat agent that edits the project plan in
natural language. Import/export Excel. The agent never writes to the database
directly — it only translates natural language into structured operations
through **MCP tools**; the backend validates every operation, applies it
atomically, and **deterministically recomputes the schedule**. Task dates are
always *derived*, never stored.

> Status: **Backend (Phase 1 + 2) complete and gated.** Frontend (Phase 3) in
> progress. Demo gif to follow once the local demo scenario passes its gate.

```

Both the REST routes and the MCP tools go through **one `services.py` layer**, so
an edit made by the agent and an edit made by the user behave identically and
both broadcast `{version, diff}` over the WebSocket.

## 2. How MCP is used

The LLM is **not the source of truth** and has **no direct access to the data**.
It can only call four MCP tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `get_plan()` | current plan with computed dates |
| `validate_patch(patch)` | dry-run: diff + errors, **not applied** |
| `apply_patch(patch)` | apply atomically, recompute, broadcast, return diff |
| `undo_last()` | revert to the previous snapshot |

Why a tools layer instead of letting the LLM write to the DB: every mutation is
**validated** (existence, cycles, durations), **atomic** (one bad op rolls back
the whole patch), and the schedule is **deterministically recomputed** by code,
not the model. The model's job is just NL → structured `Patch`; correctness is
the backend's job. This is what makes the system robust to the choice of model
(see [Model selection](#8-model-selection)).

## 3. How the agent works

Loop (`apps/backend/app/llm/agent.py`, max 10 iterations):

1. `list_tools()` from the MCP server → convert schemas to OpenAI tools format
   (`mcp_openai_bridge.py`).
2. user message → `chat.completions` with tools → `tool_calls`
   → `session.call_tool()` → results fed back → repeat until a final text answer.
3. Guidance: read the plan first (`get_plan`), check with `validate_patch`, then
   `apply_patch`; mass edits are **one** patch with a selector (e.g.
   `by_assignee`), not N calls.

The agent is transport-agnostic: it takes a connected MCP `ClientSession` and an
OpenAI-compatible client, so the whole loop is unit-tested offline with a fake
LLM, and the live 10-command gate runs against a real model.

## 4. Excel format

Import columns (case-insensitive, whitespace-normalized headers), first sheet
only, `read_only=True`:

```
задача, описание, исполнитель, длительность, предшественники
```

- **предшественники** — task *names*, comma-separated, resolved to ids;
  an unknown name is a clear user error.
- **длительность** — integer ≥ 1; an invalid value errors with the **row number**.
- **Export** adds computed `дата начала`, `дата конца`.

See `examples/sample_plan.xlsx` (same as the demo seed).

## 5. Local setup

### Backend (works today)

```bash
cd apps/backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate            # Windows;  source .venv/bin/activate on *nix
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp ../../.env.example .env         # then put your OPENROUTER_API_KEY in .env
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

- Offline tests: `pytest -m "not live"` (63 passed).
- Live agent gate (needs `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`): `pytest tests/test_agent_scenarios.py`.

### Frontend (Phase 3) — **requires Node.js 20+**

```bash
cd apps/frontend
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173, proxies the API to :8000
```

### docker-compose

`docker-compose up` (both services) — to be added with Phase 3 delivery.

## 6. Deployment

Frontend → Vercel, backend → Render. Details to be finalized after the local
demo gate.

## 7. Excel + API reference

```
GET  /api/plan                GET  /api/health
POST /api/upload-excel        POST /api/undo
GET  /api/export-excel        POST /api/reset-demo
POST /api/chat  (SSE)         WS   /ws   → {version, diff}
```
CORS origin comes from `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`.

## 8. Model selection

The model is chosen with the single env var `LLM_MODEL` (OpenRouter id). The
default is **`anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`**.

Measured on the Phase 2 gate — the 10 reference commands
(`apps/backend/tests/test_agent_scenarios.py`):

| Model | Correctness | Stability | Time / full run |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`** (default) | **10 / 10** | **5 / 5 runs** | ~86–104 s |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` | **10 / 10** | 1 run (control) | ~140 s |

Both models pass every command. Haiku 4.5 matches Sonnet 4.5's correctness at
roughly **1.5× lower latency and cost**, so it is the default.

**Takeaway:** correctness comes from the tools/validation/scheduler layer, not
from the model — so the architecture is **robust to the choice of model**.
Upgrading is a **one-variable change**: set `LLM_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`
(or any OpenRouter model) in `.env`; no code changes.

> Note: an earlier `.env` used `anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku`, which returns
> HTTP 404 ("No endpoints found") on OpenRouter — the correct current id is
> `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`.

## 9. AI assistants usage

This project was built with Claude Code (Opus 4.8), tracked per phase in
[docs/AI_USAGE.md](docs/AI_USAGE.md): what was delegated, what the model got
wrong and how it was fixed, and what was verified by hand. Highlights:

- Domain, scheduler, validators, patches, Excel I/O, storage, and the full MCP +
  agent backend were generated with Claude Code, then gated by tests.
- Notable fixes made in-dialogue: `offset_days` to keep dates derived while
  supporting shifts; refusing shifts before the earliest date; documenting the
  op-payload catalog in tool descriptions (fixed agent flakiness prompt-only).

## 10. Known limitations

- **Calendar days**, not working days (working-day scheduling is on the roadmap).
- Excel round-trip does not preserve a manual shift (`offset_days`) — the 5-column
  format has no place for it; structure is preserved (documented + tested).
- Single project, no auth, no drag-and-drop field editing (out of scope by spec).
- Agent SSE streams events (`tool`/`applied`/`message`/`done`), not token-by-token.

## 11. Roadmap

See [docs/ROADMAP_TO_PRODUCTION.md](docs/ROADMAP_TO_PRODUCTION.md) *(to be added
with Phase 3)*.
